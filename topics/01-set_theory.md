# Set Theory

This course will teach you some elementary Set Theory. We look at basic properties of sets, how to define a set, and how to compare different sizes of sets.

## Introduction

Sets can be found almost anywhere. For example, we can define a set of all humans on the planet and take one person as an element of that set. All the words in a language can be seen as a set, a word as an element of it. Now for some formal definitions.

To define a set $$A$$ with the elements $$1,2,3$$ we write:

$$ A = \{1,2,3\} $$

If we have an element $$a$$, that is in our set, we write:

$$ a \in A $$

If we have an element $$b$$, that is not in our set, we write:

$$ b \notin A $$

Now we can easily describe the state of our world like so:

$$ B = \{I, you, he, she, it, we, they\} $$

$$ you \in B $$

$$ his \notin B $$

Sets are defined by their elements, not by the order of their elements. That means $$\{1,2,3\} $$ and $$\{3,1,2\} $$ is the same set. Also, sets know only unique elements. The set $$\{1,2,3\} $$ and $$\{1,1,2,2,3,3\}$$ is still the same set.
