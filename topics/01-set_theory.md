# Set Theory

This course will teach you some elementary Set Theory. We look at basic properties of sets, how to define a set, and how to compare different sizes of sets.

## Introduction

Sets can be found almost anywhere. For example, we can define a set of all humans on the planet and take one person as an element of that set. All the words in a language can be seen as a set, a word as an element of it. Now for some formal definitions.

To define a set $$A$$ with the elements $$1,2,3$$ we write:

$$ A = \{1,2,3\} $$

If we have an element $$a$$, that is in our set, we write:

$$ a \in A $$

If we have an element $$b$$, that is not in our set, we write:

$$ b \notin A $$

Now we can easily describe the state of our world like so:

$$ B = \{I, you, he, she, it, we, they\} $$

$$ you \in B $$

$$ his \notin B $$

Sets are defined by their elements, not by the order of their elements. That means $$\{1,2,3\} $$ and $$\{3,1,2\} $$ is the same set. Also, sets know only unique elements. The set $$\{1,2,3\} $$ and $$\{1,1,2,2,3,3\}$$ is still the same set. We don't always have to, or can, write down all elements in a certain set. In this case, we will use a shorthand notation $$\{a,b,c,\dots\}$$.

We can visualize sets using Venn Diagrams. Here we define two different sets, that have no elements in common.

Enumerating all elements is possible for small sets, however if we have many (or infinite) elements in one set, we rather describe elements by their properties. For a property $$P$$ and an element $$e$$ of a set $$S$$, we write $$P(e)$$ to indicate that $$s$$ has the property $$P$$. Now we have the possibility to shorten our notation:

$$ A = \{e âˆˆ S : P(e)\} $$

This reads: The set $$A$$ consists of all elements $$e$$, of the set $$S$$, with the property $$P$$. The colon $$:$$ is read a "such as".
