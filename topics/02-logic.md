# Predicate Logic

Logic as a formal system can be used by linguistics compare and analyze natural language. This formal system can be defined very clearly and thus be also used in computer science, for example: In the field of Artificial Intelligence formal logic can be used for reasoning. We will look at some basic logic formalims and then briefly look at Lambda calculus.

## Introduction

In sentential (or propositional) logic sentences (or propositions) are the smallest unit, these sentences can either be *true* or *false*. This is called a **Boolean**, a variable that can only take on the values true or false. Usually variables are represented by single capital letters. Let us see some examples:

$$ M = The\ moon\ orbits\ earth $$

$$ E = The\ earth\ is\ flat $$

$$ M = True $$

$$ E = False $$

We can see that both these propositions can have a true or false (boolean) value.

## Operations

Furthermore, we can combine simple sentences to form more complex utterances. These combinations can be seen as operations on the propositions, returning again either true or false.

### Conjunction

The conjunction can be translated as the word "and". It yields true if both conjuncts are true and false if any of the conjuncts is false. Let us first define some sentences:

$$ S = Saturn\ has\ a\ ring = True $$

$$ J = Jupiter\ is\ a\ gas\ giant = True $$

$$ M = The\ moon\ is\ made\ of\ green\ cheese = False $$

Now we can perform a conjunction to combine these, changing the resuling boolean.

$$ S \land J = True $$

This translates to: "Saturn has a ring and Jupiter is a gas giant", which is true.

$$ M \land J = False $$

This translates to: "The moon is made of green cheese and Jupiter is a gas giant", which is false.

### Disjunction

$$ \lor $$

### Negation

$$ \neg $$

### Conditional

$$ \rightarrow $$
