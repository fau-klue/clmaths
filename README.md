# Mathematics for Computational Linguistics

This is a small collection of basic mathematics for your off-the-shelf Computer Linguist.

# Development and Contributing

This website is generated using Ruby Jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/

So that means you will have to install Ruby and Bundler on your system.

Installation of dependencies:

```bash
bundle install --path=.bundle
```

Running the local Jekyll server:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site can then be reached at: http://localhost:4000/clmaths/
